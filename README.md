# Student-Grade-Generator-Toy-Problem
This is a Student Grade Generator that prompts the user to input student marks. The input is between 0 and 100 which stands as the minimum and maximum score every students can score. Then the output of the respetive grade is given below: A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C - 59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40. I used Javascript to wire down the solution.

# Speed-Detector
This is a Speed Detector program that takes the input of the speed of a car e.g 80 km/s. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points. For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

# Net-Salary-Calculator
